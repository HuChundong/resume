The project has two branches:

* [master](https://github.com/PinkyJie/resume/tree/master)  branch for development, change code and run `grunt serve` to preview the page in live-reload, when done, run `grunt build` ready for production
* [gh-pages](https://github.com/PinkyJie/resume/tree/gh-pages)  branch for production, using the Github naming convention for branch naming, after running `grunt build` in master branch, switch to this branch using `git checkout gh-pages` and run 'build.bat'(easily to transform to Linux platform)
